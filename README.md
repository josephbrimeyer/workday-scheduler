# Your Project Title

The title of this project is 'Workday-Scheduler'.

## Description 

Workday-Scheduler is a simple calendar application that allows the user to save events for each hour of the day. This app will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by jQuery.  The calendar allows the user to enter and store information in 9, 1 hour time-slots in a calendar on the browser.  The events are stored in local storage in the browser and the data is retained upon refreshing the browser page.  Additionally, there is the ability to overwrite and edit entries in the calendar.  The calendar is responsive to the current date and time and will show past hours as gray, current hour as red, and future hours as green.  The Workday-Scheduler utilizes HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, and Moment.JS.  In the future, I will update this app to incorporate real time functionality by utilizing set interval for date and time validation.

Workday-Scheduler is hosted on github.  The installation requires that the user launch the application in their browser by clicking the following link:
